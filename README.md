# Ansible Collection - piliman974.desktop

Tired of spending long nights or entire days installing or reinstalling your workstations? This playbook is for you.

I have been working in IT for 26 years. Over all these years, I have lost a lot of time installing or reinstalling my personal and professional workstations. Since discovering Ansible in 2012/2013, I have built a set of playbooks with the suite of tools I usually install on my Linux (Ubuntu) or macOS machines.

This new version brings together all the work done over the years. No more manually installing your applicationsâ€”just complete the variables and run the playbook!
